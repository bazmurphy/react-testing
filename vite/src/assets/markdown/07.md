## 7. Anatomy of a Test

- `test()` accepts 3 arguments:

  1. name - the first argument is the test name used to identify the test
  2. function - the second argument is the function that contains the expectations to test
  3. timeout - the third argument is the timeout which is an optional argument for specifying how long to wait before aborting the test. the default timeout value is 5 seconds.

- Note we can also use `it()` as an alternative to `test()`

```jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

test("renders learn react link", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

1. we use the `test` method from Jest
2. argument 1: name `renders learn react link`
3. argument 2: function `() => {}`
4. We use the `render` method from React Testing Library to create a Virtual DOM using the `App` component
5. We use `screen` from React Testing Library which contain methods to query the Virtual DOM
6. We use `.getByText()` which accepts a string or a regular expression as its argument `/learn react/i`
7. We `expect` the `linkElement` `.toBeInTheDocument()` (which is called a matcher function)
8. If we run this test it Passes
9. notice that `test` and `expect` are not imported because CRA globally provides those from Jest
10. So we use Jest and React Testing Library to create a test in a React Project.
