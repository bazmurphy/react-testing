## 4. Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

- Focus on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class or a function or a component
- Each unit or building block is tested in isolated, independent of other units
- Dependencies are mocked
- Run in a short amount of time and make it very easy to pinpoint failures
- Relative easier to write and maintain

### Integration Tests

- Focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together
- Take longer than unit tests

### End to End Tests

- Focus is on testing the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish
- Involves a real UI, a real backend database, a real service etc.
- Take the longest, as they cover the most amount of code
- Have a cost implication as you interact with real APIs that may charge based on the number of requests

### Testing Pyramid

![Testing Pyramid Image](testing-pyramid.png)

- the bulk of your tests are Unit Tests at the bottom of the Pyramid
- As you move up the Pyramid your tests get larger but at the same time the number of tests gets smaller
- Unit Tests are easier to write and maintain, but End to End tests give you the most confidence as they closely resemble a User testing your application

- RTL Philosophy: "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you."

- RTL strikes a balance between Unit tests in the sense they are at a component level and easy to write and maintain and End to End tests in the sense they resemble the way a user would interact with the Component.

- With RTL we are not concerned about the implementation details of a component (We are not testing how it is rendering text or how it is updating state or how it is handling a click event)

- Instead we are testing how the component behaves when a user interacts with it.

(Example: RTL doesn't care if you add 4+4 or 5+3 to display the number 8)

- Any refactoring done to a Component with not affect your test as long as the end result is the same (Functional Testing?)

### What is an Automated Test?

- It throws an error when the actual output does not match the expected output

Basic JavaScript Test Example (without Library/Framework):

```js
function getFullName(firstName, lastName) {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}

const actualFullName = getFullName("Baz", "Murphy");
const expectedFullName = "Baz Murphy";

if (actualFullName !== expectedFullName) {
  throw new Error(`${actualFullName} is not equal to ${expectedFullName}`);
}
```
