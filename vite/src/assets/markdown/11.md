## 11. Filtering Tests

- we can use `w` then `o` to only run tests related to changed files
- we can use `p` to filter by filename - we then enter a regex pattern (or some text and select the file)
- we can use `t` to filter by the test name - we then enter some text and select the test
- to clear the filter use `w` and then `c`

- on the global `test()` method you can use `.only` so `test.only()` in which case Jest will pickup only that test to run
- using `.only()` is common when working on a file that contains multiple tests
- using `.skip()` will tell Jest to skip that test

- when using `it()` instead of `test()`
  - the equivalent for `only` is `f` (focus it) so: `fit()`
  - the equuivalent for `skip` is `x` (exclude it) so: `xit()`
