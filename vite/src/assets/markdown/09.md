## 9. Test Driven Development

- Test Driven Development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the software code
- Once the tests have been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass

1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
2. Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed
3. Refactor the code for optimisation while ensuring the tests continue to pass

- Also called red-green teesting as all tests go from a red failed state to a green passed state

- We write a new test `GreetTDD.test.tsx`
- We create an empty `GreetTDD.tsx`

```jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { GreetTDD } from "./GreetTDD";

test("GreetTDD renders correctly", () => {
  render(<GreetTDD />);
  const textElement = screen.getByText("Hello");
  expect(textElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("GreetTDD renders with a name", () => {
  render(<GreetTDD name={"Baz"} />);
  const textElement = screen.getByText("Hello Baz");
  expect(textElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

- We then run the Test and of course it FAILs both
- We write the `GreetTDD.tsx` component
- (TypeScript: we define a Props Type with OPTIONAL `name?`)

```jsx
type GreetTDDProps = {
  name?: string,
};

export const GreetTDD = (props: GreetTDDProps) => {
  return <div>Hello {props.name}</div>;
};
```

- And now run the Tests and they PASS
