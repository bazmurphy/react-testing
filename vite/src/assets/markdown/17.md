## 17. RTL Queries

- Every test we write generally involves the following basic steps:

  1. Render the component
  2. Find an element rendered by the component
  3. Assert against the element found in step 2. which will pass or fail the test

- For 1. we use the `render` method from RTL
- For 3. we use `expect()` passing in a value and combine it with a **matcher** function from `jest` or `jest-dom`

- For 2. we need to use RTL Queries
- Queries are the methods that RTL provides to find elements on the page

- To find a single element on the page:

  - `getBy`
  - `queryBy`
  - `findBy`

- To find multiple elements on the page, we have:

  - `getAllBy`
  - `queryAllBy`
  - `findAllBy`

- Each of these methods need to be combined with a suffix to form the actual query

- The suffix can be one of

  - `Role`
  - `LabelText`
  - `PlaceHolderText`
  - `Text`
  - `DisplayValue`
  - `AltText`
  - `Title`
  - `TestId`

- It is important to understand the behaviour of each of these methods, along with the individual suffix, as it is fundamental to RTL

- `getBy`
  - class of queries return the matching node for a query
  - and throw a descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found
