## 18. `getByRole`

- `getByRole` queries for elements with given role

- What is a role? Role refers to the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) role which provides semantic meaning to content to ensure people using assistive technologies are able to use them.

- `button` element has a button role
- `anchor` element has a link role
- `h1` to `h6` have a heading role
- `checkboxes` have a checkbox role
- `radio` buttons have a radio role
- etc

- If you are working with elements that do not have a default `role` or if you want to specify a different role, the role attribute can be used to add the desired role.

- To use an anchor element as a button in the navbar, you can add `role="button"`
