## 3. Jest vs React Testing Library

### Jest

- Jest is a JavaScript framework
- Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs the tests, determines whether the tests passed or failed and reports it back in a human readable manner

### React Testing Library

- RTL is a JavaScript testing utility that provides virtual DOM for testing React components
- RTL provides a virtual DOM which we can use to interact with and verify the behaviour of a React component
- RTL is a family of packages which helps test UI components
- The core library is called DOM Testing Library and RTL is a wrapper around this core library to test React applications in an easier way
