## 16. What to Test?

- Guideline starting point for what is worth testing in a React Component

- Test that the Component **renders**

- Test that the Component renders **when given props**

- Test that the Component renders **in different states** (eg. user logged in or not)

- Test that the Component **reacts to events** (eg. buttons / form controls)

#### What Not To Test

- Implementation Details - the more closely your tests resemble how the software is being used the better - you want tests that test the behaviour and not how that behaviour is implemented

- Third Party Code - you should be testing code that you are writing in your Project and not code you are consuming from an external library

- Code that is not Important from a User's Point of View (eg. a utility function to format a Date - only test if the date was rendered in the expected format)
