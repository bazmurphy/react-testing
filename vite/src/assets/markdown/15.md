## 15. Assertions

- When writing tests we often need to check that values meet certain conditions
- Assertions decide if a test passes or fails

- with Jest assertions are carried out with the global `expect()` method
- the `expect(value)` method accepts 1 argument
- the `value` argument should be the value that your code produces

- in the `Greet` example it is a DOM Node

- You will rarely call `expect()` by itself

- Typically you will use expect along with a **"matcher"** function to assert something about a value

- A **"matcher"** can optionally accept an argument which is the correct expected value

- in the `Greet` example is it `.toBeInTheDocument()` which does not need an argument and verfies if the DOM Node is present in the DOM

- To start with its hard to know which **"matcher"** functions we can use when writing a test, so visit https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers to see a list of commonly used **"matchers"**

  - Numbers:
  - `expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);`
  - `expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);`

  - Strings:
  - `expect('Christoph').toMatch(/stop/);`

  - Arrays/Iterables:
  - `expect(shoppingList).toContain('milk');`

  - Error
  - `expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(Error);`

- Jest out of the box contains **"matcher"** functions for JavaScript testing that does not involve a UI or the DOM.

- We extend the list of Jest **"matchers"** by adding an additional package called `jest-dom`

- With CRA `jest-dom` is already installed for us if we look in `package.json` we can see in `"dependencies":` `"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",` and if we look at `setupTests.ts` we can see `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';`

- `setupTests.ts` is a global file that is automatically executed before Jest runs a test

- if we visit https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom we can see a list of Custom Matchers as well as Documentation for WHEN to use a particular **"matcher"** function
  - `toBeInTheDocument`
  - `toBeEnabled` - for buttons/inputs
  - `toHaveClass`
  - `toHaveValue`
