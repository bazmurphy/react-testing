## 10. Jest Watch Mode

- When we run `npm run test` it starts Jest in `--watch` mode
- Watch Mode is an option that we can pass to Jest asking to watch files that have changed since the last commit and execute tests related only to those changed files
- An optimisation designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have
