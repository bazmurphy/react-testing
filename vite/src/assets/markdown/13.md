## 13. Filename Conventions

- We are not restricted to the `FileName.test.tsx` convention with CRA and Jest

  - Files with `.test.js` or `.test.tsx` suffix
  - Files with `.spec.js` or `.spec.tsx` suffix
  - Files with `.js` or `.tsx` suffix in `__tests__` folders (at any depth in the src folder)

- Recommended to always put your tests next to the code they are testing so that relative imports are shorter
